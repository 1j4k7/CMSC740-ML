# CMSC740-geometry-processing

Learning check assignments for CMSC740. The assignments are in Jupyter Lab notebooks, and we are using Docker to setup the environment. To get started:

- Install Docker, https://docs.docker.com/install/
- Clone this repository into a local directory
- IMPORTANT: Make sure that your local directory has write permissions for all users. E.g., on Windows go to folder properties, then select the "Security" tab, and allow the "Users" group "Full control".
- Go to your local clone of this repository, and in the file `jupyterlab-cmsc740-run.bat`, replace `c:/Docker/CMSC740-geometry-processing` with the directory where the file is stored locally
- Run `jupyterlab-cmsc740-run.bat` from the command line 
- Follow the instructions in the command line interface to open Jupyter Lab

You find the assignments for each learning check in their own folder on the left pane in Jupyter Lab.
